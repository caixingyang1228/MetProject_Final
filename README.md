**All three projects explore how to search and push Met's collection in different ways.**

***Introduction:***

In this project, I try to connect the present with the past, and make the news that changes in real time related to history. By using the New York Times Api,  the contents of NYT home page would be replaced by pictures of Met's collection. Search the collection of the relevant country by the country name tag associated with each news.

***What can be improved:***

1. This project has not been made into a page that can updated in real time. I will try to make it into a web page or Chrome Extension can function in real time.

2. Add more search categories to convert news into more relevant works.

***Introduction:***

This is a Chrome Extension that can select any word on the web page and use it as a keyword search for Met's collection. Then click Search button to go to the Met homepage.

***What can be improved:***

1. Search for multiple pictures at the same time.

2. Make a website that can save the searched artworks.

***Introduction:***

It is only a mockup of the app, which can also be a function of the Original Met app. It would search Met's collection by collecting daily life data and pushed it to users.
